# Amazon Review Sentiment Analyzer

A sentiment analysis web app that allows users to analyze Amazon-style product reviews using a RoBERTa-based model from Hugging Face. Built using Gradio for the UI, this app supports both **single review input** and **CSV file upload** for batch analysis

## Features

-  **Single Review Analysis**  
  Enter a single product review and get the predicted sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) along with confidence scores

-  **CSV Upload for Bulk Analysis**  
  Upload a `.csv` file with a column named `review`. The app will analyze each row and return a new file with predicted sentiment and confidence scores
